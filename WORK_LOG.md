Immediately we identified the biggest thing which is zoning, being able to eliminate large parts of the dataset efficiently so that you have to search less and less of it each time. Thus, this helps with efficiency. Similarly: we tried to apply bit shifting techniques to see if there are more efficient ways to loop through this string dataset. Lastly, I was thinking maybe stacks or some sort of map of stacks could be utilized to check the order of repeats. However, this would still run in linear time as it wouldn't eliminate any sections. |
| Oct. 13 |  8:00pm - 8:35pm  |  Thought more about different solutions to this problem, I continued with the stack idea and was thinking about how if we use a map, a map for each base (ACTG) that mapped to a stack which would contain the index of the most recent instance of that base. From there on we could loop through the stack while being able to skip large chunks of each stack if a base was misrepresented or broke the pattern. Similarly, I thought about how to integrate this with landon's idea of separating the overall list of bases into subsections that can searched, his idea helps with minimizing the number of elements searched in total which is the biggest efficiency boost you can have. I'n not sold on the idea that this is the right approach to this problem but its interesting to think about, I'm still somewhat confident this problem set will trend in the direction of integer bit scale math operations, bitwise operations. |
