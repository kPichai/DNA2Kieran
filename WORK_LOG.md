| Oct. 10 | 11:15am - 11:55am | This session during class I talked with Tony and Isha at the whiteboard about potential solutions to this problem. Immediately we identified the biggest thing which is zoning, being able to eliminate large parts of the dataset efficiently so that you have to search less and less of it each time. Thus, this helps with efficiency. Similarly: we tried to apply bit shifting techniques to see if there are more efficient ways to loop through this string dataset. Lastly, I was thinking maybe stacks or some sort of map of stacks could be utilized to check the order of repeats. However, this would still run in linear time as it wouldn't eliminate any sections. |
