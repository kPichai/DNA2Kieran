Immediately we identified the biggest thing which is zoning, being able to eliminate large parts of the dataset efficiently so that you have to search less and less of it each time. Thus, this helps with efficiency. Similarly: we tried to apply bit shifting techniques to see if there are more efficient ways to loop through this string dataset. Lastly, I was thinking maybe stacks or some sort of map of stacks could be utilized to check the order of repeats. However, this would still run in linear time as it wouldn't eliminate any sections. |
| Oct. 13 |  8:00pm - 8:35pm  | Thought more about different solutions to this problem, I continued with the stack idea and was thinking about how if we use a map, a map for each base (ACTG) that mapped to a stack which would contain the index of the most recent instance of that base. From there on we could loop through the stack while being able to skip large chunks of each stack if a base was misrepresented or broke the pattern. Similarly, I thought about how to integrate this with landon's idea of separating the overall list of bases into subsections that can searched, his idea helps with minimizing the number of elements searched in total which is the biggest efficiency boost you can have. I'n not sold on the idea that this is the right approach to this problem but its interesting to think about, I'm still somewhat confident this problem set will trend in the direction of integer bit scale math operations, bitwise operations. |

I continued to talk about my idea of representing each base as a pair of 2 bits. For example, A would be 00, C would be 01, T would be 10, and G would be 11. This allows us to mathematically and numerically encode each set of bases into a unique integer. Because, in binary there is only 1 way to represent the number 7 in an 8 bit system, 000000111. Similarly, this would allow us to represent 4 bases uniquely as a 8 bit integer. 10000111 would represent TACG, there is no other way to represent that string with this bit system making it unique. |
| Oct. 14 |  9:25am - 9:55am  |                        After thinking about the merits and possibilities of this system me Tony and Isha began to discuss edge cases in which you might miss parts of longest repeats if you just iterated by the length of the STR. For example, if your STR was AGA, and you sequence was AGAGAAGAAGA. If you iterated normally and saw the first AGA but then skipped the rest because they were still AGA, but shifted incorreclty you only wouldve gotten 1 STR. However, in this case the longest STR repeat cycle is 3. Similarly, we came up with the idea of using bit shifting as our method of iterating through the array rather than construcuting and comparing with .equals for strings, instead if we use the concept above and bit shift by 2 then add the 2 bits that correspond to A for example we could effectively iterate through the sequence. I then began to code a function that encodes a given string into binary. |

Intiially, it had issues with bit shifting, so I changed the logic of the for loop and then it worked. I tested different permutaitons of ACTG (TAGC, GATC, etc) to see if it acted as expected and it did. In the meanwhile I also brainstormed more ways to solve the issue above, me and tony had talked about using an arraylist to keep track of all the possible starting places of a new sequence so that you wouldn't need one but I'm trying to think of a potentially more efficient way of doing this without utilizing an arraylist. Isha mentioned just keeping a temporary variable of the very last possible STR repeat beginning you see, I think this idea has lots of merit and I will try to implement it soon. |

I essentially created substrings of the original sequence and converted them to integers then bit shifted them to iterate thorugh them. I used this to check if we found a match along the way however this didn't work as when I tested the final result I got 0 consistently. I traced my code with the first example and got it close to working, for the first 3 test cases my result was 1 greater than the expected. However, it failed badly at the largest and chromosome 22 examples. I'll have to figure that issue out in the future though I'm glad it seems to be very close to working effectively. The error I realized was my logic for assigning and creating the next set of n bases (where n is the length of the ) |
